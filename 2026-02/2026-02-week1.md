2026-02-01 Vercel Express deployment failure (Gemini expense audit app) 
S: Backend failed to deploy on Vercel
A: I initially treated it as a build issue, but identified a runtime mismatch between Vercel’s serverless model and a persistent Express server executed via `tsx`
R: Separated infrastructure strategy and redeployed backend to a compatible hosting environment


Deployment failed because Vercel’s serverless runtime is incompatible with a persistent Express server executed via `tsx`, which assumes a long-running Node.js process.
